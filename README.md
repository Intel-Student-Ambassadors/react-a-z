## Description

This project is a simple React app that demonstrates the use of JSX and how it is transpiled to regular JavaScript code.

The code snippet provided shows the implementation of the `App` component. It imports `logo` from './logo.svg' and the CSS file './App.css'. Additionally, it imports `React` from 'react' to enable the use of JSX syntax.

The commented code block inside the `App` function represents the original JSX code. JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. However, browsers do not understand JSX directly, so it needs to be transpiled or compiled to regular JavaScript code.

In the un-commented code block, the JSX elements are transformed into `React.createElement` calls. This is the format that React uses to create elements in JavaScript. The JSX attributes are passed as objects to the `React.createElement` function.

For example, the original JSX:

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <header className="App-header">
    <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
    <p>
      Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
    </p>
    <a
      className="App-link"
      href="https://reactjs.org"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Learn React
    </a>
  </header>
</div>
```

Is transpiled to:

```jsx
React.createElement("div", { className: "App" },
  React.createElement("header", { className: "App-header" },
    React.createElement("img", { src: logo, className: "App-logo", alt: "logo" }),
    React.createElement("p", null,
      "Edit ",
      React.createElement("code", null, "src/App.js"), " and save to reload."),
    React.createElement("a", {
      className: "App-link",
      href: "https://reactjs.org",
      target: "_blank",
      rel: "noopener noreferrer"
    },
      "Learn React"
    )
  )
);
```

As of React version 17.x and later, the import of `React` is not compulsory, as React does that automatically for you. However, in older versions, including the import explicitly is required.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

In this section, we will explore how to use JSX to efficiently display images, text, and utilize attributes in JSX elements. Additionally, we will delve into the process of transpiling JSX code into plain JavaScript that can be easily understood by the browser.

## Issue

In case you come across the error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'package name' in 'your/path/here'", address this by running the command `npm install` (and consider restarting the development server if needed). This action will guarantee the installation of the required dependencies, successfully resolving the issue.
