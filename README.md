## Description

**App.js:**

1. The code starts by importing the `Header` component from the './components/Header' file. This means that the `Header` component is defined in a separate file and can be used in this file.

2. The `App` component is declared as an arrow function (`const App = () => {...}`). In modern React, this is a functional component.

3. Inside the `App` component, there's a return statement with JSX code. JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code.

4. The `<>...</>` is a shorthand syntax for React Fragments. Fragments allow you to return multiple elements without wrapping them in an additional DOM node.

5. Inside the return statement, the `Header` component is used with a prop `text="Feedback UI"`. This prop is passed to the `Header` component and will be used to display the header text.

6. There's also a `<div>` element with a class name of 'container' that contains an `<h1>` element with the text "My App". This is the main content of the app.

7. The `App` component is then exported as the default export using `export default App`.

```jsx
import Header from './components/Header'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header text="Feedback UI" />
      <div className='container'>
        <h1>My App</h1>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

**Header.jsx:**

1. The code starts by importing `PropTypes` from the 'prop-types' library. PropTypes is used for typechecking the props passed to a component.

2. The `Header` component is declared as an arrow function (`const Header = ({text}) => {...}`). It is a functional component that accepts a single prop called `text`.

3. Inside the `Header` component, there's a return statement with JSX code representing the header section of the app.

4. The `<header>` element contains a `<div>` element with a class name of 'container' that wraps an `<h2>` element. The content of the `<h2>` element is determined by the `text` prop passed to the `Header` component.

5. Before the `Header` component is defined, there are two additional blocks of code:

   - `Header.defaultProps`: This sets a default prop value for the `text` prop. If the `text` prop is not provided when using the `Header` component, it will default to "Feedback UI".

   - `Header.propTypes`: This defines the expected prop types for the `Header` component. In this case, it specifies that the `text` prop should be of type `string`. If the `text` prop is provided but not a string, a warning will be shown in the console during development.

6. Finally, the `Header` component is exported as the default export using `export default Header`.

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

const Header = ({text}) => {
  return (
    <header>
      <div className="container">
        <h2>{text}</h2>
      </div> 
    </header>
  );
};

Header.defaultProps = {
  text: 'Feedback UI'
}

Header.propTypes = {
  text: PropTypes.string
}

export default Header;
```

Overall, this code represents a basic React application with a main `App` component and a reusable `Header` component. The `Header` component accepts a prop called `text`, and if the prop is not provided, it will default to "Feedback UI". The `App` component uses the `Header` component to display the header section of the app and also contains the main content of the app.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

In this section, we will explore how to create your first React component and use it in your application. We'll start with the `App` component, which uses the `Header` component to display the header section of the app with the text "Feedback UI". The `App` component also contains the main content of the app.
