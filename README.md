## Description

The `App` component in this project showcases various features and concepts of React. Let's break down the code step by step:

```javascript
const title = 'Blog Post';
const body = 'This is my blog post';

const comments = [
  { id: 1, text: 'Comment one' },
  { id: 2, text: 'Another comment' },
  { id: 3, text: 'more than just two' },
];
```

- In the above lines, we define three variables: `title`, `body`, and `comments`. These variables hold dynamic values. `title` and `body` store strings, while `comments` is an array of objects containing comment data.

```javascript
return (
  <div className='container'>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{body}</p>
    {/* Any expressions in curly braces are always within the returned JSX statement - to go from JSX to JS */}
    <p>5 + 5 = {5 + 5}</p>
    <p>Random Number: {Math.random() * 10}</p>
    <h2>{title.toUpperCase()}</h2>

    <div className='comments'>
      <h3>Comments ({comments.length})</h3>
      <ul>
        {comments.map((comment, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{comment.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

- The `return` statement defines the JSX structure that represents the user interface of the `App` component.
- We use curly braces `{}` to insert dynamic values into JSX. For example, `{title}` and `{body}` are replaced with the values stored in the `title` and `body` variables.
- We can also perform computations within curly braces. For instance, `{5 + 5}` will be transpiled to `10` in the compiled code, and `{Math.random() * 10}` will be replaced with a random number between 0 and 10 during transpilation.
- In the code, we use the `map` function to iterate through the `comments` array and dynamically generate a list of comments using JSX. Each comment's text is displayed within `<li>` elements, and the `key` prop is set to the `index` for better performance when rendering lists.

By understanding this code, you'll gain insights into using dynamic values and lists in JSX elements, which are crucial concepts when building interactive and data-driven React applications.

## Installation

## Usage

In this section, you will learn how to use dynamic values in JSX elements to display content based on variables, and how to create lists of elements using the `map` function. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building interactive and data-driven React applications.
