## Description

There is a simple React application that displays a list of feedback items using components like `FeedbackList`, `FeedbackItem`, `Header`, and a main component named `App`. The data for the feedback items is stored in the `FeedbackData` constant, and it is managed using the `useState` hook in the `App` component.

### Component Tree

A component tree refers to the hierarchical structure of React components in your application. The component tree represents the relationship between parent and child components, with the root component being the top-level parent. Each component can have zero or more child components, forming a tree-like structure.

Both `Header` and `FeedbackList` are children to the `App` component.

To illustrate:

```jsx
<App> (Parent)
  └── <Header> (Child)
  └── <div className='container'>
        └── <FeedbackList feedback={feedback} /> (Child)
      </div>
```

**Using React Devtools:**

Once the React Developer Tools extension is installed in your browser, you can open it to access the component tree and inspect individual components. When you run your React application, you will see the component tree with `App` as the parent component and `FeedbackItem` and `Header` as the children components of the `App` component. You will also see the props passed to `Header` and the state used in `FeedbackItem` in the React Devtools.

**Updating State:**

To update the state in the `App` component, you can utilize the `useState` hook to manage the feedback data dynamically. For example, you can add, remove, or modify feedback items by updating the `feedback` state.

1. **FeedbackItem Component:**
   - The `FeedbackItem` component is a functional component that receives a destructured prop named `item`. Inside this prop, there are two properties: `rating` and `text`.
   - The component renders a card-like structure with the `rating` and `text` displayed on the screen. The `rating` is displayed inside a `div` with the class `num-display`, and the `text` is displayed inside another `div` with the class `text-display`.
   - This component will be used to represent individual feedback items in the `FeedbackList` component.

2. **FeedbackList Component:**
   - The `FeedbackList` component is a functional component that receives a prop named `feedback`. This prop is an array of feedback items, which will be passed from the `App` component.
   - The component first checks if the `feedback` array is either falsy or has a length of zero. If true, it returns a paragraph saying "No Feedback Yet".
   - If there is feedback data, the component maps through each item in the `feedback` array and renders a `FeedbackItem` component for each item. It passes the individual feedback item as the `item` prop to the `FeedbackItem` component.
   - Each `FeedbackItem` component is assigned a unique `key` prop, which is set to the `id` property of the corresponding feedback item. This helps React efficiently update the virtual DOM when the feedback list changes.

3. **FeedbackData Constant:**
   - The `FeedbackData` constant is an array containing three objects, each representing a feedback item.
   - Each feedback item has an `id`, `rating`, and `text` property, representing the unique identifier, the rating value, and the feedback text, respectively.

4. **App Component:**
   - The `App` component is the main component of the application. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the `feedback` state, initializing it with the data from the `FeedbackData` constant.
   - The component renders the `Header` component at the top of the page and the `FeedbackList` component within a `div` with the class `container`.
   - The `FeedbackList` component receives the `feedback` state as a prop, so it can display the list of feedback items based on the current state.

Overall, we have a React application that displays a list of feedback items using the `FeedbackList` component, with each feedback item represented by the `FeedbackItem` component. The data for the feedback items is stored in the `FeedbackData` constant and is managed using the `useState` hook in the `App` component. The `Header` component provides a header section for the application.

### Installation of React Dev Tool

To inspect and debug your React application, you can use the React Developer Tools extension for your browser.

- If you are using **Google Chrome**, simply search for "React Dev Tool" in your browser's search bar, click the link related to Chrome, and [add the extension to Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi).

- If you are using **Microsoft Edge**, search for "React Dev Tool" in your browser's search bar, and [get the extension from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/react-developer-tools/gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil).

- If you are using **Mozilla Firefox**, go to the add-ons section and search for [React Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/).

Once you have added this extension to your browser, you can use it to inspect and analyze the component tree, props, and state of your React application, making the development and debugging process more efficient.

1. To utilize the React Developer Tools, you can use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` to open the browser console tab, then navigate to the Component tab.

2. Here, you will see the component tree with `App` as the parent component and `FeedbackItem` and `Header` as the children components of the `App` component.

3. You will also see the props passed to `Header` and the state used in `FeedbackItem` in the React Devtools.

4. Currently, there is no state in the application. However, when we start discussing the Feedback Form, you will see updates in the React Developer Tools.
