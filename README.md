## Description

To convert the provided code to use reducers, we'll need to refactor the components that use state and useState hooks. Instead of managing state using individual useState hooks, we'll create a single reducer to manage the state for each component. Here's the refactored code:

Step 1: Create a Reducer

Create a new file named `feedbackReducer.js` and define the reducer function for each component that uses state. We'll use this reducer to manage the state for FeedbackForm, FeedbackItem, and FeedbackList components:

```javascript
const feedbackReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_INITIAL_STATE':
      return {
        ...state,
        text: action.payload.text,
        btnDisabled: action.payload.btnDisabled,
        message: action.payload.message,
        rating: action.payload.rating,
      };
    case 'SET_TEXT':
      return { ...state, text: action.payload };
    case 'SET_BTN_DISABLED':
      return { ...state, btnDisabled: action.payload };
    case 'SET_MESSAGE':
      return { ...state, message: action.payload };
    case 'SET_RATING':
      return { ...state, rating: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export { feedbackReducer };
```

Step 2: Refactor FeedbackForm Component

In the `FeedbackForm` component, we'll use the `useReducer` hook to manage the state:

```javascript
import { useContext, useEffect, useReducer } from 'react';
import FeedbackContext from '../../context/FeedbackContext';
import Card from '../shared/Card';
import Button from '../shared/Button';
import Rating from '../Rating';
import { feedbackReducer } from '../../context/feedbackReducer';

const initialState = {
  text: '',
  btnDisabled: true,
  message: null,
  rating: 0,
};

const FeedbackForm = () => {
  const { addFeedback, updateFeedback, feedbackEdit } =
    useContext(FeedbackContext);

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(feedbackReducer, initialState);

  const handleTextChange = (e) => {
    const newText = e.target.value;

    if (newText.trim() === '') {
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_TEXT', payload: newText });
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_BTN_DISABLED', payload: true });
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_MESSAGE', payload: null });
    } else if (newText.trim().length < 10) {
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_TEXT', payload: newText });
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_BTN_DISABLED', payload: true });
      dispatch({
        type: 'SET_MESSAGE',
        payload: 'Text must be at least 10 characters',
      });
    } else {
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_TEXT', payload: newText });
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_BTN_DISABLED', payload: false });
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_MESSAGE', payload: null });
    }
  };

  const handleFormSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    if (state.text.trim().length > 9) {
      const newFeedbackItem = {
        text: state.text,
        rating: state.rating,
      };

      if (feedbackEdit.edit === true) {
        updateFeedback(feedbackEdit.id, newFeedbackItem);
      } else {
        addFeedback(newFeedbackItem);
      }

      dispatch({ type: 'SET_BTN_DISABLED', payload: true });
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_TEXT', payload: '' });
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_RATING', payload: 0 });
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    if (feedbackEdit.edit === true) {
      dispatch({
        type: 'SET_INITIAL_STATE',
        payload: {
          text: feedbackEdit.item.text,
          btnDisabled: false,
          message: null,
          rating: feedbackEdit.item.rating,
        },
      });
    }
  }, [feedbackEdit]);

  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>How would you rate your service with us?</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>
        <Rating
          selectedRating={(rating) =>
            dispatch({ type: 'SET_RATING', payload: rating })
          }
        />
        <div className='input-group'>
          <input
            placeholder='Write a review'
            type='text'
            onChange={handleTextChange}
            value={state.text}
          />
          <Button type='submit' isDisabled={state.btnDisabled}>
            Send
          </Button>
        </div>
        {state.message ? <div className='message'>{state.message}</div> : null}
      </form>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default FeedbackForm;
```

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for FeedbackItem and FeedbackList components

Do the same refactoring using `useReducer` in the `FeedbackItem` and `FeedbackList` components, managing their respective state using the reducer.

By refactoring the components to use reducers, the state management will be centralized, making the code more maintainable and easier to reason about. The reducer handles all state updates based on the dispatched actions, and each component receives its state through the `state` variable returned by the `useReducer` hook.

> **Note:**
>
> 1. Instead of passing the props down through each component, React Context allows you to broadcast props to the components below.
> 2. The useReducer hook is used for complex state manipulations and state transitions. In the next chapter or branch, we will revert to using only useContext since the app does not deal with much state.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

The code snippet below illustrates the process of acquiring the identical code from this repository onto your local machine.

```bash
# Clone the remote Git repository
git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git

# Change the current directory to the cloned repository's directory
cd react-front-to-back

# Install project dependencies using npm
npm install

# Start the application server
npm start

# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# Switch to a specific branch (replace <branch-name> with the desired branch name)
git checkout <branch-name> # for example: git checkout 35-refactor
```

The provided commands are used to clone a remote Git repository, navigate to the cloned repository's directory, install its dependencies, start the application server, list remote branches, and switch to a specific branch.

Here's a breakdown of each command:

1. `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git`: This command clones the remote Git repository from the URL `https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back` to your local machine. It creates a new directory named `react-front-to-back.git` and copies the entire repository contents into that directory.

2. `cd react-front-to-back.git`: This command changes the current working directory to the `react-front-to-back.git` directory. After executing this command, you will be inside the project directory.

3. `npm install`: This command installs the dependencies required by the application. It reads the `package.json` file in the project directory and installs all the packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections.

4. `npm start`: This command starts the application server. The specific behavior of this command depends on how it is configured in the `package.json` file. Typically, it will run the application server and make it accessible at a specific port, allowing you to interact with the application in your web browser.

5. `git branch -r`: This command lists all the remote branches in the Git repository. Remote branches are branches that exist on the remote repository (in this case, on GitHub) and not on your local machine.

6. `git checkout <branch-name>`: This command is used to switch to a specific branch. Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to. After executing this command, you will be on the specified branch, and you can start working on that branch.

In summary, these commands are commonly used to clone a Git repository, set up a local development environment by installing dependencies, start the application server, and switch to a specific branch to work on a particular feature or bug fix.

## Issue

In case you come across the error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'package-name' in 'your/path/here'", address this by running the command `npm install` (and consider restarting the development server if needed). This action will guarantee the installation of the required dependencies, successfully resolving the issue.
