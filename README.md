## Description

In this section, we will explore how to use conditionals in JSX to dynamically render content based on certain conditions. We will see how to use the `if` statement and the `&&` operator for conditional rendering. Additionally, we'll explore an alternative approach using the ternary operator (`condition ? trueBlock : falseBlock`) to achieve the same result in a more concise way.

In the provided `App` component, we can observe the usage of conditionals in JSX to dynamically render content based on certain conditions. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The `loading` and `showComments` variables are used to control the conditional rendering in the component. These variables could be set based on API calls or other data fetching operations.

2. The `if (loading)` statement checks if the `loading` variable is true. If it is true, the component returns a `<h1>` element with the text "Loading...". This is a simple way to display a loading message while waiting for data to load.

3. The conditional rendering for the `showComments` variable is implemented using the `&&` operator. The expression `{showComments && (...)}` checks if `showComments` is true. If it is, the content inside the parentheses is rendered; otherwise, nothing is rendered.

### Alternative: Ternary Operator

Instead of using the `if` statement for conditional rendering, an alternative approach is to use the ternary operator (`condition ? trueBlock : falseBlock`). The ternary operator is a concise way to express conditional logic in a single line.

The equivalent code using the ternary operator would be:

```jsx
return (
  <div className='container'>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{body}</p>
    <p>5 + 5 = {5 + 5}</p>
    <p>Random Number: {Math.random() * 10}</p>
    {loading ? (
      <h1>Loading...</h1>
    ) : (
      showComments && (
        <>
          <h2>{title.toUpperCase()}</h2>
          <div className='comments'>
            <h3>Comments ({comments.length})</h3>
            <ul>
              {comments.map((comment, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{comment.text}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>
        </>
      )
    )}
  </div>
);
```

In this alternative code, the ternary operator is used to conditionally render the loading message when `loading` is true, and the `showComments` section when `loading` is false and `showComments` is true.

Using the ternary operator provides a more concise and readable way to handle conditional rendering in JSX and is commonly used in React applications for its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

The code snippet below illustrates the process of acquiring the identical code from this repository onto your local machine.

```bash
# Clone the remote Git repository
git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git

# Change the current directory to the cloned repository's directory
cd react-front-to-back

# Install project dependencies using npm
npm install

# Start the application server
npm start

# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# Switch to a specific branch (replace <branch-name> with the desired branch name)
git checkout <branch-name> # for example: git checkout 35-refactor
```

The provided commands are used to clone a remote Git repository, navigate to the cloned repository's directory, install its dependencies, start the application server, list remote branches, and switch to a specific branch.

Here's a breakdown of each command:

1. `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git`: This command clones the remote Git repository from the URL `https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back` to your local machine. It creates a new directory named `react-front-to-back.git` and copies the entire repository contents into that directory.

2. `cd react-front-to-back.git`: This command changes the current working directory to the `react-front-to-back.git` directory. After executing this command, you will be inside the project directory.

3. `npm install`: This command installs the dependencies required by the application. It reads the `package.json` file in the project directory and installs all the packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections.

4. `npm start`: This command starts the application server. The specific behavior of this command depends on how it is configured in the `package.json` file. Typically, it will run the application server and make it accessible at a specific port, allowing you to interact with the application in your web browser.

5. `git branch -r`: This command lists all the remote branches in the Git repository. Remote branches are branches that exist on the remote repository (in this case, on GitHub) and not on your local machine.

6. `git checkout <branch-name>`: This command is used to switch to a specific branch. Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to. After executing this command, you will be on the specified branch, and you can start working on that branch.

In summary, these commands are commonly used to clone a Git repository, set up a local development environment by installing dependencies, start the application server, and switch to a specific branch to work on a particular feature or bug fix.

## Issue

In case you come across the error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'package name' in 'your/path/here'", address this by running the command `npm install` (and consider restarting the development server if needed). This action will guarantee the installation of the required dependencies, successfully resolving the issue.
