## Description

The custom component named `Card`, which is a wrapper component used to create a card-like layout in the application. The component accepts two props, `children` and `className`, and renders its children inside a `<div>` element with the specified `className`.

**Explanation of `Card` Component:**

1. The `Card` component is a functional component that takes in two props, `children` and `className`.
2. The `children` prop represents the content that will be placed inside the `<div>` element created by the `Card` component.
3. The `className` prop is used to apply custom CSS classes to the `<div>` element, allowing the component's appearance to be customized by passing different class names as a prop.

**Custom Component:**
The `Card` component is a custom component. It is custom because it is not a built-in HTML element or a part of any React library. It has been defined by the developer to encapsulate specific functionality and styling for creating cards in the application.

**Default Props for `Card` Component:**
The `className` prop is set as part of the default props for the `Card` component. Default props are used to provide fallback values for props in case they are not explicitly provided when using the component. If the `className` prop is not provided when using the `Card` component, it will default to an empty string (`''`).

**Example of Default Props:**
Here's an example of defining default props for the `Card` component:

```jsx
const Card = ({ children, className }) => {
  return <div className={className}>{children}</div>;
};

Card.defaultProps = {
  className: 'card', // The default value for className is 'card'
};

export default Card;
```

In the example above, if you use the `Card` component without passing a `className` prop, it will use the default value `'card'` as the CSS class for the `<div>` element.

**Usage in `FeedbackItem` Component:**
In the `FeedbackItem` component, the `Card` component is used to create a card-like layout for displaying feedback items. The `className` prop is passed to the `Card` component with the value `'card'`, which is a custom CSS class used to style the card.

```jsx
import Card from './shared/Card';

const FeedbackItem = ({ item: { rating, text } }) => {
  return (
    <Card className='card'>
      <div className='num-display'>{rating}</div>
      <div className='text-display'>{text}</div>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default FeedbackItem;
```

By using the `Card` component, the `FeedbackItem` component can easily create consistent and reusable card elements for each feedback item in the application. The `className` prop allows the card's styling to be customized based on the specific needs of the application.
