## Description

In both `App.js` and `FeedbackList.jsx`, the `framer-motion` library is used to add animations to components. The animations help create smooth transitions and visual effects when components are mounted, unmounted, or updated. Let's explore how `framer-motion` is used in each file:

1. `FeedbackList.jsx`:

In this file, `framer-motion` is used to animate the individual `FeedbackItem` components when they are added or removed from the list. The `AnimatePresence` component from `framer-motion` is used to wrap the list of `FeedbackItem` components. It allows `framer-motion` to handle the animations when components are added or removed.

For each `FeedbackItem` component, a wrapping `motion.div` is used to apply animations to the individual items. The `motion.div` component is provided with `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` props to define how the item should behave during its initial mount, while it is present, and when it is removed from the list, respectively. In this case, `opacity` is animated from 0 to 1 during the initial mount, and from 1 to 0 during the exit.

**2.** `App.jsx`:

In this file, `framer-motion` is used to animate the custom delete confirmation modal that appears when a user wants to delete a feedback item. The modal is conditionally rendered based on the `showDeleteModal` state.

Just like in `FeedbackList.jsx`, the `motion.div` component is used to animate the modal's appearance (`initial` and `animate` props) and disappearance (`exit` prop). Additionally, the inner content of the modal (the actual delete confirmation content) is also animated using another `motion.div`. This allows for separate animations on the modal itself and its inner content.

The following animations are applied to the modal:

- For the modal's appearance, it scales from `scale: 0.5` to `scale: 1`, and its opacity changes from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`.
- For the modal's disappearance, it scales from `scale: 1` to `scale: 0.5`, and its opacity changes from `opacity: 1` to `opacity: 0`.

In both cases, `framer-motion` handles the animations in a declarative manner by providing the necessary properties (`initial`, `animate`, and `exit`) for the components involved in the animation.

These animations help create a more visually appealing and interactive user experience by adding smooth transitions and visual cues during certain actions like adding feedback items to the list or confirming the deletion of a feedback item.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

The usage of the `framer-motion` library in both `App.js` and `FeedbackList.jsx` is to add animations to components and create smooth transitions and visual effects during different scenarios. Here's a summary of how `framer-motion` is used in each file:

1. `FeedbackList.jsx`:

- `framer-motion` is used to animate the individual `FeedbackItem` components when they are added or removed from the list.
- The `AnimatePresence` component from `framer-motion` is used to wrap the list of `FeedbackItem` components, allowing the library to handle the animations when components are added or removed.
- Each `FeedbackItem` component is wrapped in a `motion.div` component, which applies animations to the individual items. The `motion.div` component is provided with `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` props to define how the item behaves during its initial mount, presence, and when it is removed from the list.
- In this case, the `opacity` property is animated from 0 to 1 during the initial mount, and from 1 to 0 during the exit, creating a fade-in and fade-out effect.

**2.** `App.jsx`:

- `framer-motion` is used to animate the custom delete confirmation modal that appears when a user wants to delete a feedback item.
- The modal is conditionally rendered based on the `showDeleteModal` state.
- The modal itself is wrapped in a `motion.div` component, which animates its appearance (`initial` and `animate` props) and disappearance (`exit` prop).
- Additionally, the inner content of the modal (the actual delete confirmation content) is also animated using another `motion.div`. This allows for separate animations on the modal itself and its inner content.
- For the modal's appearance, it scales from `scale: 0.5` to `scale: 1`, and its opacity changes from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`, creating a scaling-up effect with fading in.
- For the modal's disappearance, it scales from `scale: 1` to `scale: 0.5`, and its opacity changes from `opacity: 1` to `opacity: 0`, creating a scaling-down effect with fading out.

Overall, `framer-motion` is used to create visually appealing and interactive animations in both files, enhancing the user experience by providing smooth transitions and visual cues during certain actions like adding feedback items or confirming deletions.

## Issue

In case you come across the error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'package name' in 'your/path/here'", address this by running the command `npm install` (and consider restarting the development server if needed). This action will guarantee the installation of the required dependencies, successfully resolving the issue.
