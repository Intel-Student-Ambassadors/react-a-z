## Description

In the provided `App` component, we can observe the usage of conditionals in JSX to dynamically render content based on certain conditions. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The `loading` and `showComments` variables are used to control the conditional rendering in the component. These variables could be set based on API calls or other data fetching operations.

2. The `if (loading)` statement checks if the `loading` variable is true. If it is true, the component returns a `<h1>` element with the text "Loading...". This is a simple way to display a loading message while waiting for data to load.

3. The conditional rendering for the `showComments` variable is implemented using the `&&` operator. The expression `{showComments && (...)}` checks if `showComments` is true. If it is, the content inside the parentheses is rendered; otherwise, nothing is rendered.

### Alternative: Ternary Operator

Instead of using the `if` statement for conditional rendering, an alternative approach is to use the ternary operator (`condition ? trueBlock : falseBlock`). The ternary operator is a concise way to express conditional logic in a single line.

The equivalent code using the ternary operator would be:

```jsx
return (
  <div className='container'>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{body}</p>
    <p>5 + 5 = {5 + 5}</p>
    <p>Random Number: {Math.random() * 10}</p>
    {loading ? (
      <h1>Loading...</h1>
    ) : (
      showComments && (
        <>
          <h2>{title.toUpperCase()}</h2>
          <div className='comments'>
            <h3>Comments ({comments.length})</h3>
            <ul>
              {comments.map((comment, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{comment.text}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>
        </>
      )
    )}
  </div>
);
```

In this alternative code, the ternary operator is used to conditionally render the loading message when `loading` is true, and the `showComments` section when `loading` is false and `showComments` is true.

Using the ternary operator provides a more concise and readable way to handle conditional rendering in JSX and is commonly used in React applications for its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Usage

In this section, we will explore how to use conditionals in JSX to dynamically render content based on certain conditions. We will see how to use the `if` statement and the `&&` operator for conditional rendering. Additionally, we'll explore an alternative approach using the ternary operator (`condition ? trueBlock : falseBlock`) to achieve the same result in a more concise way.
