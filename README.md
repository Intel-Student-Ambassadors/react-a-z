## Description

Welcome to the React Create React App Folder Structure! This project covers a wide range of core and advanced concepts in React. Throughout this journey, we will explore React Hooks, fetching APIs using libraries like axios, fetch, swr, and more. We will also dive into using other frameworks with React, such as Tailwind, Chakra UI, and MUI. Our focus will include performing CRUD operations from the front end and understanding how React communicates with the backend. Additionally, we'll explore techniques to optimize the performance of our React applications, and we will work on various projects that will reinforce our learning.

Navigate through different repository branches based on their names, as each branch represents a chapter that builds on top of the previous one. I highly recommend going through the chapters from top to bottom to get the most out of this learning experience.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- React: The main framework or library for building the frontend.
- React DOM: Works with the Document Object Model (DOM) alongside the React library.
- React Scripts: Provides additional tools like the development server.
- Web Vitals: Allows you to monitor performance analytics.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

In this section, we will explain how to use the project. We will provide examples or code snippets, if applicable. If your project requires any specific environment variables, configurations, or setup, we will include that information here.

### Public Folder

The `public` folder contains the single-page application (SPA) entry point, `index.html`. The `div` with the id `root` serves as a placeholder for our entire frontend or UI. You can also include any external CDN links or remove comments from `index.html` optionally. Additionally, the `public` folder may include other static assets such as favicon and images.

### Src Folder

The `src` folder is where you'll create your components and write the main logic for your application. This is where most of your development work will take place.
